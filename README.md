## How to run

The game is build with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) without additional dependencies. 

Only a webserver that can serve static content is required to run and host the game.

For local test / demo purposes, you can use Python, for example by running `python3 -m http.server`, afterwards the game is accessible via http://localhost:8000.

If you prefer nodejs, install the http server `npm install http-server -g` and run `http-server` in the same directory as the game source.
